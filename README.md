Explanation:<br />
Enigma works as follows:<br />
Each letter is transformed through the plugboard, right rotor, middle rotor, left rotor, reflector, and in reverse all the way to the plugboard again.

An Enigma configuration is defined by the 3 selected rotors (out of 5), their initial offsets, their initial setting and plugboard configuration.
